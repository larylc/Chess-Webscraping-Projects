##  Introduction 
This repository contains several chess related web scraping projects. My goals were to practice using webscraping tools like pandas.read_html, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium to extract and analyze data from chess websites.

Chess player performance is measured using an Elo rating system where wins, draws, and losses cause ratings to fluctuate. Using this rating information, chess federations like the world chess federation (FIDE) and the United States Chess Federation (USCF) publish public monthly player lists. In addition to ratings, federations also publish player attributes like sex, country, date of birth, etc. This makes chess websites a rich source for data science related projects.
